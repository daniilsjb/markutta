# Markutta

Markutta is a _quick_, _simple_, and _progressive_ [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
editor with automatic conversion to HTML and CSS.

> Type your markup in the editor and see it being rendered on the screen 🔥

## Features

- Edit your Markdown documents and see them visualized in real-time. 📝
- Import any Markdown or text files from your filesystem directly into the editor. 🚀
- If you don't like using buttons, simply drag and drop your file onto the webpage. 💧
- Export your markup either as raw or styled HTML files without external dependencies. 🥳
- And, of course, there are both light and dark themes to help you feel more comfortable. 😎

This software is powered by several _amazing_ libraries and tools:
